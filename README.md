# ECG_Myocardial_Infarction

This project is created because I wanted to experiment on time-series related data and in the healthcare division.
After checking for some healthcare related dataset on http://timeseriesclassification.com/
The dataset found is corresponding to both my needs.

## Dataset

The dataset used is from http://timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=ECG200
Which is extracted from the Thesis "Generalized feature extraction for structural pattern recognition in time-series data" of R. Olszewski (https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/935627)

## Goals

The goals for this project is to:
- Understand the data
- Rightly  manipulate data
- Find a good model that fit the datatype
- Approach the 89% as much as possible

## Data & Context

To better understand how to classify the data, I need to learn to do it myself, prior to make a NN learn it.
This way, here's a list of sources/links I've found/used to help me:
- https://www.osmosis.org/learn/ECG_cardiac_infarction_and_ischemia
- https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myocardial-ischemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20375417
- https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/600227
- https://geekymedics.com/how-to-read-an-ecg/
- https://oxfordmedicaleducation.com/ecgs/ecg-interpretation/
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction

Wih a better understanding of the need, I'll change my dataset and/or rounding if necesserary to bett
