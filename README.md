# ECG_Myocardial_Infarction

This project is created because I wanted to experiment on time-series related data and in the healthcare division.
After checking for some healthcare related dataset on http://timeseriesclassification.com/
The dataset found is corresponding to both my needs.

## Dataset

The dataset used is from http://timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=ECG200
Which is extracted from the Thesis "Generalized feature extraction for structural pattern recognition in time-series data" of R. Olszewski (https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/935627)

## Goals

The goals for this project is to:
- Understand the data
- Rightly  manipulate data
- Find a good model that fit the datatype
- Approach the 89% as much as possible
